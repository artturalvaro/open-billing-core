# Open Billing Core

Open Billing Core is an event-driven billing engine written in Go,
designed to handle subscriptions, recurring payments and failure scenarios
commonly found in SaaS and fintech products.

This project focuses on correctness, explicit state transitions and
infrastructure-agnostic design.

> This is not a payment gateway. It is a billing core.
